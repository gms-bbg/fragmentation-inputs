# fragmentation-inputs
Fragmentation inputs for ECP and CCS

## Description of folder contents

### 2021-new-makefp
Inputs used the new MAKEFP and OpenMP EFP-EFP codes. EFP settings are
- polarization: on (full version)
- dispersion: on (direc version)
- CT: on
- EXREP: on
- Coulomb: 0 (the overlap-based screening is included when EXREP is on.)

### hydration
Contains water solvated MSN inputs.  The MSN- 6, 11, 16, 22, 27 and 32 structures from **[new\_msn\_inputs](https://github.com/gms-bbg/fragmentation-inputs/tree/master/new_msn_inputs)** are solvated with water molecules.  These are currently being looked at for the GAMESS ECP performance analysis for the November 2020 review.  See subfolders for EFP settings.

### msn\_input\_files
Original MSN inputs generated by Bryce for the GAMESS ECP.  Note, these inputs have been replaced with a newer set of MSN inputs (see **[new\_msn\_inputs](https://github.com/gms-bbg/fragmentation-inputs/tree/master/new_msn_inputs)**).  EFP settings for these inputs:
- polarization: on
- dispersion: off

Contributor (Bryce)

### new\_msn\_inputs
Modification of Bryce's original MSN inputs files, **[msn\_input\_files]()**.  These inputs were used for the initial GAMESS ECP review in 2019. Weak-scaling communication results were generated from these inputs to show a 5% communication overhead for MPI-only EFMO/RHF.  EFP settings for EFMO inputs:
- polarization: on
- dispersion: off
