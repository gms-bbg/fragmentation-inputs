# multi-layer EFMO inputs for hydrated MSN

10 points along a reaction pathway found with molecular models

nfrag=182, Total numbers of waters = 4597

EFMO/RI-MP2/RI-CCSD(T)/6-31G/CCD-RI
RESDIM=0.5

Reactant, transition states, ... etc. are put into a separate fragment in layer 2 (RI-CCSD(T))
Everything else (MSN ring and waters) in layer 1 (RI-MP2)
