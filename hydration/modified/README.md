```
msn-NN-MMMM-PPPPxQ<solvent>-efmo_<method>.inp

Definition:

NN is the number of fragments in the MSN system (excluding the solvent)

MMMM is the number of <solvent> molecules in the solvated system

PPPP is the number of <solvent> fragments in the solvated system

Q is the number of <sovlent> moleules per fragment

<solvent> is shorthand notation to identify the solvent
    <solvent> = w = water

<method> is some notation to identify the EFMO method used
    <method> = rhf = restricted Hartree-Fock
    <method> = rimp2 = resolution of the identity MP2
